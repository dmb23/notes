# Open links is a new background tab

To get firefox to change the behavior to divert links to a new site to a
different tab and to open that tab in the background (and also open bookmarks
in a foreground tab):

* open "about:config"
* set browser.link.open_newwindow to 3
* set browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInTabs to true.
* set browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground to TRUE
