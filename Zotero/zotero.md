# Sync Paper library with Zotero

I use Zotero on different machines. My current workflow is:

- install Zotero and the ZotFile plugin
- log in with my Zotero account to sync my library
- have the attachments auto-stored in a cloud-synced folder by ZotFile
- use a linked library to refer to those files in Zotero.

Let's see if that works.
