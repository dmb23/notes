# Convert an iTunes Podcast feed to RSS

EX:

    https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/mythology/id1442945036?mt=2

load this link with the ID:

    https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=1442945036&entity=podcast

Get the "feedUrl" from this json file.

The &entity=podcast is not necessary but it may help.
