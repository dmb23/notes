# Notes

Some things I learned at some point. Hopefully I don't have to learn them again,
when I write them down.

Heavily inspired by "Today I learned"

## About

I used the setup from [jima80525](https://github.com/jima80525/til)
who shamelessly stole this idea from
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til),
who claims to have stolen
it from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
